# binary-search-tree

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">Binary Search Tree</a> is a tree that stores elements in a way that allows operations such as searching efficiently (if balanced).

This repository implements self-balancing BST using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL Tree</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-Black Tree</a>.

I made it as a learning project, so the implementation is probably horrible. I'm currently creating an <a href = "https://github.com/Eddard-jpg/ordered_set">Ordered Set</a> with hopefully better and clearer implementation.
